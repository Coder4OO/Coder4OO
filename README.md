### 👋 Hey, I'm **coder400**

I'm a developer who likes exploring ideas through code — mostly in **Python** and **C/C++**.  
I enjoy understanding how things work under the hood, automating small tasks, and building tools that just *do their job quietly.*

### 🌙 My Approach
I like small, focused projects that teach me something new.  
No hype — just clean, working code and quiet progress.

---

### 📅 Now
- Working on some Python / C projects 
- Writing small Python utilities  
- Cleaning up and refactoring older repos
